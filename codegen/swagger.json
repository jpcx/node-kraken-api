    "description": "# General Usage\n\nThis document details use of Kraken's REST API for our spot exchange. The [Websockets API](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets) and [Kraken Futures API](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012894412-Futures-API) are documented separately. Our REST API is organised into publicly accessible endpoints (market data, exchange status, etc.), and private authenticated endpoints (trading, funding, user data) which require requests to be signed.\n\n## Support \n\nFurther information and FAQs may be found on the [API section](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000080686-API) of our support pages. If you have trouble making any standard requests that our system permits, please [send us](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000104043) a full copy of the request(s) that you're attempting, including your IP address and all headers, so that we may investigate further.\n\n## Requests, Responses and Errors\n\n### Requests\nRequest payloads are [form-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), and all requests must specify a `User-Agent` in their headers.\n\n### Responses\nResponses are JSON encoded and contain one or two top-level keys (`result` and `error` for successful requests or those with warnings, or only `error` for failed or rejected requests)\n\n#### Example Successful Response\n```javascript\n{\n  \"error\": [],\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"online\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-03-22T17:18:03Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n> GET https://api.kraken.com/0/public/SystemStatus\n\n#### Example Rejection\n```javascript\n{\n  \"error\": [\n    \"EGeneral:Invalid arguments:ordertype\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Error Details\n\nHTTP status codes are generally not used by our API to convey information about the state of requests -- any errors or warnings are denoted in the `error` field of the response as described above. Status codes __other__ than 200 indicate that there was an issue with the request reaching our servers.\n\n`error` messages follow the general format `<severity><category>`:`<error msg>`[`:add'l text`]\n\n* `severity` can be either `E` for error or `W` for warning\n* `category` can be one of `General`, `Auth`, `API`, `Query`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Funding`, or `Service`\n* `error msg` can be any text string that describes the reason for the error\n\n#### Some Common Examples\n\n| Error | Additional Info |\n| -- | -- |\n| EGeneral:Invalid arguments | The request payload is malformed, incorrect or ambiguous. |\n| EService:Unavailable | The matching engine or API is offline |\n| EService:Market in cancel_only mode | Request can't be made at this time. (See `SystemStatus` endpoint.) |\n| EService:Market in post_only mode | Request can't be made at this time. (See `SystemStatus` endpoint.) |    \n| EAPI:Invalid key | An invalid `API-Key` header was supplied (see Authentication section) |\n| EAPI:Invalid signature | An invalid `API-Sign` header was supplied (see Authentication section) |\n| EAPI:Invalid nonce | An invalid `nonce` was supplied (see Authentication section) |\n| EGeneral:Permission denied | API key doesn't have permission to make this request. |    \n| EOrder:Cannot open position | User/tier is ineligible for margin trading |\n| EOrder:Margin allowance exceeded | User has exceeded their margin allowance |\n| EOrder:Margin level too low | Client has insufficient equity or collateral |\n| EOrder:Margin position size exceeded | Client would exceed the maximum position size for this pair |\n| EOrder:Insufficient margin | Exchange does not have available funds for this margin trade |\n| EOrder:Insufficient funds | Client does not have the necessary funds |\n| EOrder:Order minimum not met | Order size does not meet `ordermin`. (See `AssetPairs` endpoint.)  |\n| EOrder:Orders limit exceeded | (See Rate Limits section) |\n| EOrder:Rate limit exceeded | (See Rate Limits section) |\n| EOrder:Positions limit exceeded |  |\n| EOrder:Unknown position |  |\n\nAdditional information can be found on our [support center](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001491786-API-error-messages).\n\n\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthenticated requests must include both `API-Key` and `API-Sign` HTTP headers, and `nonce` in the request payload. `otp` is also required in the payload if two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.\n\n\n## Nonce and 2FA\n\n### `nonce`\n\nNonce must be an always increasing, unsigned 64-bit integer, for each request that is made with a particular API key. While a simple counter would provide a valid nonce, a more usual method of generating a valid nonce is to use e.g. a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.\n\n> **Note:** There is no way to reset the nonce for an API key to a lower value, so be sure to use a nonce generation method that won't produce numbers less than the previous nonce. Too many requests with invalid nonces (EAPI:Invalid nonce) can result in temporary bans. Problems can arise from requests arriving out of order due to API keys being shared across processes, or from system clock drift/recalibration. An optional \"nonce window\" can be configured to specify a tolerance between nonce values. Additional info can be found in our [support pages](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000906023-What-is-a-nonce-).\n\n### `otp`\n\nIf two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for the API key and action in question, the one time password must be specified in the payload's `otp` value.\n\n\n## Headers and Signature\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n# Rate Limits\n\nWe have various safeguards in place to protect against system abuse, order book manipulation, DDoS attacks, etc. For REST API requests, these are broadly organised into rate limits specific to the REST API, and rate limits which apply to any trading requests.\n\n> __Note:__ For clients with performance sensitive applications, we strongly recommend the use of our Websockets API for minimising request latency and receiving real-time information, reducing or eliminating the need to frequently poll REST endpoints.\n\n## REST API Rate Limits\n\n### Limits\n\nEvery REST API user has a \"call counter\" which starts at `0`. Ledger/trade history calls increase the counter by `2`. All other API calls increase this counter by `1` (except AddOrder, CancelOrder which operate on a different limiter detailed further below).\n\n| Tier         | Max API Counter | API Counter Decay |\n| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |\n| Starter      | 15              | -0.33/sec         |\n| Intermediate | 20              | -0.5/sec          |\n| Pro          | 20              | -1/sec            |\n\nThe user's counter is reduced every couple of seconds depending on their verification tier. Each API key's counter is separate, and if the counter exceeds the maximum value, subsequent calls using that API key would be rate limited. If the rate limits are reached, additional calls will be restricted for a few seconds (or possibly longer if calls continue to be made while the rate limits are active).\n\n### Errors\n\n* \"EAPI:Rate limit exceeded\" if the REST API counter exceeds the user's maximum.\n* \"EService: Throttled: [UNIX timestamp]\" if there are too many concurrent requests. Try again after [timestamp].\n\nAdditional information can be found on our [support center](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/206548367-What-are-the-API-rate-limits-).\n\n## Matching Engine Rate Limits\n\n### Limits\n\nSeparate limits apply to the number of orders clients may have open in each pair at a time, and the speed with which they may add and cancel orders in each pair. These limits vary by the account verification tier: \n\n| Tier      | Max Num Orders | Max Ratecount | Ratecount Decay |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Starter      | 60       | 60 | -1/sec |\n| Intermediate   | 80 | 125 | -2.34/sec |\n| Pro     | 225 | 180 | -3.75/sec |\n\n### Penalties\n\nThe speed is controlled by a ratecounter for each (client, pair) which starts at zero, is incremented when penalties are applied, and decremented according to the decay rates above. A penalty is added to the ratecounter for each new order placed (`AddOrder`) or cancelled (`CancelOrder`, `CancelAll`, `CancelAllOrdersAfter`) on the pair. The cancellation penalty varies according to the lifetime of the order.\n\n| Action       |    | <5sec  | <10sec | <15sec | <45sec | <90sec | <300s | >300s |\n| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| Add Order    | +1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n| Cancel Order |    | +8 | +6 | +5 | +4 | +2 | +1 | 0 |\n\n> __Note:__ A client's exact ratecounter values can be monitored via the Websockets [openOrders](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/#message-openOrders) feed.\n\n### Errors\n\n* \"EOrder:Orders limit exceeded\" if the number of open orders in a given pair is exceeded\n* \"EOrder:Rate limit exceeded\" if the user's max ratecount is exceeded for a given pair\n\nAdditional information can be found on our [support center](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045239571).\n\n# Changelog\n\n* Sep 2021 - Add REST `AddOrder` support for optional parameter `timeinforce` and value `ioc` (Immediate-or-cancel)\n* July 2021 - Allow querying of `WithdrawStatus` with read-only API key permission \"Query Ledgers\".\n\n**Note:** Most changes affecting our APIs or trading engine behaviour are currently being tracked on our [Websockets](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/#changelog) changelog, until these documents are combined.\n\n# Example API Clients\n\nIn order to achieve maximum performance, security and flexibility for your particular needs, we strongly encourage the implementation of this API with your own code, and to minimise reliance on third party software.\n\nThat being said, in order to aid with rapid development and prototyping, we're in the process of producing 'official' API clients in Python and Golang that will be actively maintained, coincident with the release of newer versions of both our Websockets and REST APIs. In the meantime, our Client Engagement team has compiled a number of [code snippets, examples and Postman collections](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003946512-Example-API-Code) that many find useful. \n\n### Third Party Software\n\nBelow are other third party API client code libraries that may be used when writing your own API client. Please keep in mind that Payward nor the third party authors are responsible for losses due to bugs or improper use of the APIs. Payward has performed an initial review of the safety of the third party code before listing them but cannot vouch for any changes added since then, or for those that may be stale. If you have concerns, please contact support.\n\n| Language      | Link |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| C++ | [https://github.com/voidloop/krakenapi](https://github.com/voidloop/krakenapi) |\n| Golang | [https://github.com/Beldur/kraken-go-api-client](https://github.com/Beldur/kraken-go-api-client) |\n| NodeJS | [https://github.com/nothingisdead/npm-kraken-api](https://github.com/nothingisdead/npm-kraken-api) |\n| Python 3 | [https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex](https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex)       |\n| Python 2 | [https://github.com/veox/python2-krakenex](https://github.com/veox/python2-krakenex) |\n\nOther \n"

        "description": "CancelAllOrdersAfter provides a \"Dead Man's Switch\" mechanism to protect the client from network malfunction, extreme latency or unexpected matching engine downtime. The client can send a request with a timeout (in seconds), that will start a countdown timer which will cancel *all* client orders when the timer expires. The client has to keep sending new requests to push back the trigger time, or deactivate the mechanism by specifying a timeout of 0. If the timer expires, all orders are cancelled and then the timer remains disabled until the client provides a new (non-zero) timeout.\n\nThe recommended use is to make a call every 15 to 30 seconds, providing a timeout of 60 seconds. This allows the client to keep the orders in place in case of a brief disconnection or transient delay, while keeping them safe in case of a network breakdown. It is also recommended to disable the timer ahead of regularly scheduled trading engine maintenance (if the timer is enabled, all orders will be cancelled when the trading engine comes back from downtime - planned or otherwise).\n",
